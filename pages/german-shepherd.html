                        <p>
                            The German Shepherd is very good for being a watchdog and hence it do not welcome guests to home. But when trained from a puppy it will suit itself for making new friends. 
                            German Shepherd like to be always with somebody and they can be its master or his family members or else its partner. The German Shepherd is very intelligent and active hence they should be always kept busy, exercised and playing. 
                            Nowadays many of them are trained well and made as four legged stars.

                            When we see all around the world many of them are involved in helping the physically challenged people. Also they are very important personnels in working with police and military for finding the criminals. 
                            Their excellent sniffing power works very good when given proper training for finding illegal smuggling. But basically the breed was set in to herd the sheep and protect them from predators.
