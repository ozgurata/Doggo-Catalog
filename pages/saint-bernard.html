                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        <p>
                            Today&#39;s Saint Bernard is not a large dog, he is a giant dog. Weighing in at 140-200 pounds and standing 28 to 35 inches tall, he is a lot of dog. 
                            Bred with mastiffs and large mountain dogs, they have proportional and powerful build. They are strong, sturdy and well muscled. 
                            They have either a smooth or rough (short or long) coat. Their eyes are brown or occasionally blue. They have tight lids, and square heads and muzzles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are two coat types called smooth and rough, or short and long. 
                            The smooth shorter coat is tough, flat and close against the body and the long, rough coat is dense, wavy and heavy around the legs, neck and ruff. 
                            Both types have long tails that hang low and are heavy. Saints are known to slobber, drool and snore.

                        <h3>History</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Saint Bernard breed was once called the Alpine Cattle Dogs or the Alpine Mountain Dogs. They have always been farm dogs and mountain dogs in the French and Swiss Alps. 
                            They come from the border land of Switzerland and France. They were herding dogs, hunting, search and rescue, watchdogs and draft dogs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Their ancestors are considered to include the Sennenhunds and molosser breeds that came to the Alps with the ancient Romans. 
                            There are four Sennenhund breeds that are believed to have contributed to the original Saint Bernard. 
                            These included the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog (Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund), the Appenzeller (Appenzeller Sennenhund), the Bernese Mountain Dog (Berner Sennenhund) and the Entlebucher Mountain Dog (Entlebucher Sennenhund) Today the Saint Bernard is considered a Molossoid breed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first we know of the Saint Bernard in any written records was in 1707 at the Great Saint Bernard Pass and Great Saint Bernard Hospice run by monks. There were found paintings of the dogs dating back into the late 1600&#39;s. 
                            It is told that Barry saved upward of 100 people in the Saint Bernard pass, and it is from these stories that the dogs gained their snow rescue reputation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Saint Bernard of that time did not look like the Saint Bernard does today as there was much crossbreeding. Many dogs dies during rescues in the avalanches of the mid 1800&#39;s and so they Saint was crossed with the Newfoundland to preserve the breed. 
                            You can today see the resemblance in the build and looks of the two breeds. This cross brought about the long haired Saint Bernard whose fur was too heavy for rescues.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Saint Bernards of mountain rescue fame were only about the size of a German Shepherd dog and were short haired. After crossing with the Newfoundland and moving into clubs and dogs shows, they have been bred to be much larger. 
                            Before the stud book was closed, it is thought that many larger breeds such as the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, the English Mastiff, the Tibetan Mastiff, the Rottweiler, the Great Pyrenees, the English Bulldog, the Great Dane, the Bernese Mountain Dog, the Boxer and the Caucasian Oycharka all contributed to today&#39;s Saint Bernard.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 1884 The Swiss Saint Bernard Club was founded and the breed entered the Swiss Stud book as its first entry in 1884. 
                            It was 1888 when the standard was approved and the breed became the national dog of Switzerland. 
                            Before the name Saint Bernard came to be common, these dogs might be called, Barry Dogs, Alepnmastiff, Noble Steeds or Saint Dogs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The dogs came to England in the early 1800s and to the United States soon after. 
                            They were recognized by the European kennel clubs first and by the early 1900&#39;s they were the most popular breed in the AKC.

                        <p>
                            These are giant dogs that need a lot of room. 
                            A large fenced yard or farm is best. 
                            They won&#39;t do well in an apartment. 
                            They need exercise every day and loping around a yard is very good for them. 
                            They love to play in the snow, carry a backpack or pull a cart. They love to have a &quot;job&quot;
