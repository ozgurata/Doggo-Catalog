                        <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                        <p>
                            Alaskan Husky is the best dog for the active people or families. They are bred to be working dogs. 
                            This breed is not created for it looks or pedigree, but this breed is bred purely to help with various tasks. 
                            They love being around the family, and they are very happy and cheerful. 
                            Alaskan Husky is not good watchdogs because they love everyone, including strangers. 
                            They are highly intelligent breed, but it can be tricky to train them sometimes. 
                            You must be a leader who makes decisions because if you are not confident, they will not see the reason for listening to you. 
                            The best way of training your dog would be with patience and firm, decisive manner. The old-fashioned way of training that includes punishment is not recommendable. 
                            They do not respond well to that. Training with awards is the best way to teach your dog. Alaskan Husky is a very active dog, so they are not very good for apartments. 
                            Although, you can have them in apartments but only if they have active walks and exercises. They love jogging, and they can be excellent buddies in any activity. 
                            They will love all the animals but it is important for them to socialize from the early age.
